\usage{
Metacommunity(
  comm,
  scores = 1,
  method = "r1",
  turnoverMethod = "EMS",
  sims = 1000,

  orderNulls = FALSE,
  allowEmpty = FALSE,

\arguments{
\item{comm}{community data in the form of a presence absence matrix}

\item{scores}{Axis scores to ordinate matrix. 1: primary axis scores
(default) 2: secondary axis scores. See Details.}

\item{method}{null model randomization method used by 'nullmaker'. See
details.}

\item{turnoverMethod}{(default='EMS') 'EMS' option generates null matrices 
as in Leibold and Mikkelson's original framework. However, null models
that randomize occurrences -- introducing embedded absences (bad), but in a
far less constrained null space (good) -- can also be used}

\item{sims}{number of simulated null matrices to use in analysis}

\item{order}{logical argument indicating whether to ordinate the interaction
matrix or not. Default is TRUE. See details.}

\item{orderNulls}{logical argument indicating whether to ordinate the null 
matrices. Default is FALSE.}

\item{allowEmpty}{logical argument indicating whether to allow null
matrices to have empty rows or columns}

\item{binary}{logical argument indicating whether to ordinate the community
matrix based on abundance or binary (default) data.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Prints a graphical progress bar that tracks the
creation of null matrices. Useful for conservative null models on large
and/or sparse data.}

\item{seed}{seed for simulating the null model. Null matrices should be repeatable.}

\item{sequential}{(boolean) create all null matrices at once, or calculate stats 
sequentially (memory limited users should consider using sequential=TRUE)}
}
\value{
A list of length 4, containing;
Comm -- ordinated matrix used to calculate coherence, boundary
clumping & turnover

Coherence --output of the Coherence() function, giving information on
the number of embedded absences and the significance relative to simulated
null matrices

Turnover -- output of the Turnover() function, testing the number of
species replacements relative to simulated null matrices

Boundary -- output of the BoundaryClump() function, which calculates the
Morisita's index, assessing significance using a chi-squared test
}
\description{
'Metacommunity' is a wrapper for the analysis of the three elements of
metacommunity structure (coherence, boundary clumping, & turnover) following
the framework of Leibold & Mikkelson 2002. It is important to note here that
the results of boundary clumping and turnover are only relevant if the
matrix is significantly positively coherent (i.e. empirical matrix has fewer
embedded absences than null matrices).
}
\details{
'method' is an argument handed to functions in the 'vegan' package. Leibold
& Mikkelson advocated the use of equiprobable rows and columns (provided
that rows and columns had at least one entry). This method is called 'r00'.
Methods maintaining row (site) frequencies include 'r0','r1' & 'r2'. The
default method argument is 'r1', which maintains the species richness of a
site (row totals) and fills species ranges (columns) based on their marginal
probabilities. Arguably the most conservative null algorithm is the fixed
row - fixed column total null, which can be attained using many of swap
algorithms described in the vegan package (sequential methods like 'tswap',
'swap', and non-sequential 'quasiswap' and 'backtracking'). See the help
file for 'commsim' or Wright et al. 1998 for more information.

If 'order' is FALSE, the interaction matrix is not ordinated, allowing the
user to order the matrix based on site characteristics or other biologically
relevant characteristics. The 'orderNulls' argument allows the user to ordinate 
the null matrices. While creating a more conservative test, this may negate
the null model implemented (fixed row and column sums will not be maintained)
}
\note{
This function may take awhile to finish as a result of the creation of
null matrices. If you are running multiple interaction matrices, the code
can be parallelized using the 'snow' package.
