\title{Plotting of site-by-species interaction matrices}
\usage{
Imagine(
  comm,
  col = c(0, 1),
  order = TRUE,
  scores = 1,
  fill = TRUE,
  xlab = "Species",
  ylab = "Site",
  yline = 2,
  xline = 2,
  sitenames = rownames(comm),
  speciesnames = colnames(comm),
  binary = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{community data in the form of a presence absence matrix}

\item{col}{colors used to plot interactions. First value is the background
color (no interaction) and the second color indicates an interaction.}

\item{order}{logical. Should the interaction matrix be ordered based on
reciprocal averaging scores before plotting?}

\item{scores}{axis scores to ordinate matrix. 1: primary axis scores
(default) 2: secondary axis scores}

\item{fill}{logical. Should species ranges be made coherent before plotting?}

\item{xlab}{name of the x axis}

\item{ylab}{name of the y axis}

\item{yline}{line that the y-axis label is plotted on.}

\item{xline}{line that the x-axis label is plotted on.}

\item{sitenames}{names for each row in the interaction matrix. Default is to
not plot names.}

\item{speciesnames}{names for each site in the interaction matrix. Default
is to not plot names.}

\item{binary}{logical argument indicating whether to ordinate the community
matrix based on abundance or binary (default) data.}
}
\value{
Produces an image plot of the interaction matrix. The code is very
simple, and may need to be modified if you have long site or species names,
or wish to make it prettier than I have the ability to.
}
\description{
'Imagine' produces an image plot, grid of small rectangles representing
species occurrences in sites, of a given interaction matrix.
}
\examples{

#define an interaction matrix
data(TestMatrices)
pres3c=TestMatrices[[6]]

#plot interaction matrix
Imagine(pres3c, col=c('white','blue'), order=TRUE, fill=FALSE)
