\description{
Creates null matrices based on the constraints of the null model algorithm
('method'). Also allows for null matrices with a species that occurs at no
sites, or a site without any species to be removed from the suite of
simulated null matrices. This function borrows heavily from the
commsimulator() function in the 'vegan' package, but also allows for the
fixed-fixed null model.
}
\details{
'method' is the null model algorithm used to create the null matrices. The
choice of a null algorithm is nontrivial. Leibold & Mikkelson advocated the
use of equiprobable rows and columns (provided that rows and columns had at
least one entry). This method is called 'r00'. Methods maintaining row
(site) frequencies include 'r0','r1' & 'r2', whereas species (column)
occurrences are preserved with fixed column methods such as 'c0'. The
default method argument is 'r1', which maintains the species richness of a
site (row totals) and fills species ranges (columns) based on their marginal
probabilities. Arguably the most conservative null algorithm is the fixed
row - fixed column total null, which can be attained using many of swap
algorithms described in the vegan package (sequential methods like 'tswap',
'swap', and non-sequential 'quasiswap' and 'backtracking'). Other
randomization methods are also available. See the help file for 'commsim',
or Wright et al. 1998 for more information.
